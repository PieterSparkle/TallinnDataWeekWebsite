comments Li:

* logo could be bigger right when opening the site; done
* font could be similar to the logo's font; done
* the menu is good but text should be larger and maybe centered to the page; done
* the text "how to improve the lives..." - we have this as an image from the designer, we should replace that; done
* all text could be bigger; done
* event schedule could use additional column about the specifics of who is talking/what is being discussed, which would remain "coming soon" rn
* venue could have a picture of the T1 venue on the side.
* under team: Koobass -> Koobas, and Kirstel -> Kristel; done
* the background could be some other color than completely white - maybe light blue, some hint of theme color?
