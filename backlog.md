comments Li:

* logo could be bigger right when opening the site
* font could be similar to the logo's font
* the menu is good but text should be larger and maybe centered to the page
* the text "how to improve the lives..." - we have this as an image from the designer, we should replace that
* all text could be bigger
* the "about the event" title + whole "what to expect" sections are not necessary, it doesn't catch the eye, and I'd move right on to the event schedule. the text under "about the event" could stay but be bigger + not ion completely white background
* event schedule could use additional column about the specifics of who is talking/what is being discussed, which would remain "coming soon" rn
* sponsors page could stay hidden (so a subsite), since it's not relevant for the regular attendee. 
* venue could have a picture of the T1 venue on the side.
* under team: Koobass -> Koobas, and Kirstel -> Kristel
* the background could be some other color than completely white - maybe light blue, some hint of theme color?
